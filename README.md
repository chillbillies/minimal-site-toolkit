# Minimal Site Toolkit

A set of tools, styles and templates to create minimal static sites. Includes 11ty, Nunjucks and Bootstrap.

## Prerequisites
The only prerequisite for working with these site starter tools is Node-- I recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage versions. Run `nvm use` to use the version of Node specified in the `.nvmrc` file.
